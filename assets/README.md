~~~

3. execute unit tests locally
Each time you want to merge your branch into the master, you should invoke the following command to **guarantee all your codes pass the tests**.
 
~~~
    npm test
~~~
 
4. execute end-to-end test locally
Each time you want to merge your branch into the master, you should invoke the following command to **guarantee all your codes pass the end-to-end tests**.

~~~

6. try it in your browser!

~~~
http://localhost:35337/webui/department/dp-home.html
~~~

## Manually install frontend dependency
After pulling remote repository or merging others' repository, building the code may fail as others have added new frontend dependency in the bower.json. In such case, you
need to invoke the following command to manually install those new libraries.
```
$ npm run-script bower-install
```

# Build codes
## Generate codes for Development

```
$ npm run-script deploy
```

# Test
## Unit test
We adopts the test settings of the angular-seed project. Jasmine is used as the unit test framework. Karma is choosed as the unit test runner.
